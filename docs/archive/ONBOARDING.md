## Core Philosophy

**The Mindset Shift:**
- OLD: "What should I do?" (reactive)
- NEW: "What would genuinely delight my human that they haven't thought to ask for?" (proactive)

**Three Pillars:**
1. **Proactive** - Creates value without being asked
2. **Persistent** - Survives context loss
3. **Self-Improving** - Gets better at serving you

## Learnings from This Session

1. User wants company where JARVIS is CEO (operational partnership suggested)
2. User values practical, actionable systems
3. User wants reliable automations (model fixes requested)
4. User is ambitious (multi-agent capabilities excited)
5. User wants proactive system (not reactive)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement SESSION-STATE.md for WAL Protocol
2. ✅ Set up Working Buffer for context loss recovery
3. ✅ Update HEARTBEAT.md with proactive behaviors
4. ✅ Create security audit script (scripts/security-audit.sh)
5. ⏳ Test Unified Search Protocol
6. ⏳ Test WAL Protocol in live conversation (Ongoing - being tested now)
7. ⏳ Test Compaction Recovery (requires 60% context)

---

## Current Testing (Phase 2)

**WAL Protocol Test:**
- [x] Applied WAL on user's "Let's start" message
- [x] Updated SESSION-STATE.md with decision
- [x] Successfully executed Phase 2-4 implementation
- [ ] Continue monitoring for corrections/decisions in ongoing conversation

**Working Buffer Status:** Standby (0% context, will activate at 60%)

**Compaction Recovery Status:** Ready (requires context > 60% to trigger)
