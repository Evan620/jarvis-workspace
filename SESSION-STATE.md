## Current Task Context

**Task:** AFCEN Intelligence & Execution System
**Started:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** Configuration Phase (Details Received)

**AFCEN Details Provided (2026-02-06 23:40):**
- **Mission:** AI-powered investment network catalyzing Africa's transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economy
- **Location:** Nairobi, Kenya
- **Contact:** info@africancen.org, +254 700 123 456

**Core Focus Areas (3 Pillars):**
1. **Data Intelligence:** Pan-African data network with living catalogue of climate/energy data
2. **Project Acceleration:** Moving projects from blank to bankable, fast
3. **Capital Matchmaking:** Grants, blended finance, tokenization with KYC/AML compliance

**Thematic Focus Areas:**
- Energy access and renewable energy (solar, wind, clean energy)
- Nature-based solutions (conservation, restoration, biodiversity)
- Green mining and manufacturing (lithium, cobalt, zinc)
- Sustainable agriculture and land use (climate-smart agriculture)
- Climate finance and carbon markets (carbon credits, offset projects)

**Target Beneficiaries:**
- Project developers
- Communities
- Investors
- Policymakers and institutions

**Strategic Priorities (2026):**
1. Scaling AI-powered project acceleration
2. Expanding capital access (grants, blended finance, tokenization)
3. Building pan-African data ecosystem

**Typical Funding Types:**
- Grants (early-stage project development)
- Blended finance (public + private capital)
- Tokenization (digital financing rails)

**Requirements:**
- DEEP ONLINE RESEARCH (not shallow LinkedIn/Twitter only)
- Once per night (automated deep dive)
- Multi-agent orchestration for comprehensive research
- Delivery via WhatsApp AND email
- Contextualize findings for AFCEN
- Execute approved actions

**Example Use Case:** Deep research on funding opportunities, partnerships, industry trends → Deliver via WhatsApp/email → If approved → Make application

**Progress:**
- ✅ Completed JARVIS Onboarding (Proactive Agent system)
- ✅ Designed AFCEN DEEP RESEARCH system (multi-agent, not shallow monitoring)
- ✅ Created project structure and all automation scripts
- ✅ Implemented WhatsApp + Email delivery (per user correction)
- ✅ Created 5 parallel research agents for comprehensive internet research
- ✅ AFCEN details received (mission, focus areas, priorities, funding types)
- ✅ Research keywords configured (5 sectors: energy, nature, mining, agriculture, climate finance)
- ✅ Research sources configured (30+ sources + custom climate/energy sources)
- ✅ Delivery contacts configured (WhatsApp: +254707892164, Email: ablewriters1@gmail.com)
- ✅ Geographic focus configured (Kenya, East Africa, Africa, Global)
- ✅ CONFIGURATION FIXES: Removed all "TO BE PROVIDED" fields, set defaults (2 AM research, 8 AM delivery, $50K minimum funding)
- ⏳ RESEARCH IN PROGRESS: 4 agents running in parallel

**Active Research Sessions:**
- Funding Research Specialist (60 min timeout)
- Industry Trends Analyst (45 min timeout)
- Partnership Hunter (45 min timeout)
- Events & Opportunities Tracker (30 min timeout)

**Next Actions:**
1. Wait for agents to complete (30-60 minutes)
2. Synthesize findings
3. Generate WhatsApp + Email reports
4. Verify delivery
5. Test approval workflow

## AFCEN Real-Time RAG Demo (Tuesday Panel)

**Location:** `/home/evan/clawd/projects/afcen-intelligence/realtime-demo`

**Purpose:** Live demo for AfDB panel ($229B AI fund) - positions AfCEN as pipeline partner

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Tuesday's demo

**Demo Date:** Tuesday, 2026-02-10

**How It Works:** User WhatsApp → JARVIS uses ddg-search/web_fetch/sessions_spawn → Results in 20-30s

**Files:** Reference implementations in agents/scripts + demo script in docs/

---

## Skills Needed (To Build When Requested)

1. **CIF-MDB Institutional Assessment**
   - Assess institutional frameworks (CIF, AfDB, GCF)
   - Model previous awardees
   - Recommend strategies for approval

2. **Cryptocurrency/Blockchain**
   - Jurisdiction assessment (MiCA, Kenya laws, etc.)
   - RWA tokenization guidance
   - Tokenomics modeling
   - Platform selection (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon)
   - Community building (social, airdrops, DAOs)

3. **Demo Video Generation**
   - Create professional demo videos for AFCEN platform
   - Interface with platform agents for outputs
   - (Waiting for you to share example video)

---

## Key Points to Remember

- OpenClaw = Platform/infrastructure, JARVIS = Assistant using it
- Real-time demo works via WhatsApp (+254707892164)
- Additional skills will be built on this foundation when needed
- You'll share demo video example for video generation skill

## Active Decisions & Corrections

*Use WAL Protocol: Capture corrections, decisions, preferences, proper nouns, specific values immediately.*

**Recent:**
- User wants to proceed with onboarding: "I see you have onboarding.md. Let's start." (2026-02-06 23:21)
- User confirmed start of Phase 2: Enhanced Memory implementation (2026-02-06 23:21)
- ✅ Phase 1-3 COMPLETE: All architecture, security, and tracking systems implemented (2026-02-06 23:25)
- ✅ WAL Protocol tested: Applied to this conversation (2026-02-06 23:25)
- User expects JARVIS to be proactive and stay one step ahead
- User values practical, actionable systems
- User is excited about multi-agent capabilities

**Preferences:**
- Style: Professional, efficient, proactive (from SOUL.md)
- Response pattern: Dry British wit, address as "Sir" or "Ma'am" (from IDENTITY.md)
- Tone: Not sycophantic, have opinions, be resourceful
- **Document Sharing (CRITICAL - UPDATED 2026-02-08 19:05):**
  - NOT every reply needs a Google Drive doc - use judgment
  - Only create/upload docs for substantial content (reports, plans, deliverables)
  - Short responses should be inline in WhatsApp/Telegram
  - When creating docs: Must be properly formatted (not just raw .md uploaded)
  - Convert .md to proper .docx or .pdf format when appropriate

## Draft Changes

*Work in progress - edits, drafts, partial implementations*

**None currently active**

## Quick Reference

**Important commands:**
- `session_status` - Check context % (triggers buffer at 60%)
- `memory_search("query")` - Search memory before answering
- `ls -la [path] && cat [file]` - Verify file creation after write
- `show-context` - Show current context profile and loaded files
- `switch-profile [name]` - Switch to different context profile
- `clear-context [zone]` - Reduce context to specified zone

**Protocols to apply:**
1. **WAL Protocol** - Scan messages for corrections/decisions/preferences/names → write to SESSION-STATE.md FIRST, then respond
2. **Working Buffer** - At 60% context, log every exchange to memory/working-buffer.md
3. **Unified Search** - Before saying "I don't know", search: daily notes → MEMORY.md → transcripts → grep
4. **Context Viewport** - Load only relevant files based on task; use minimal profile by default
5. **NIA-FIRST PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)** - For ANY research, code analysis, documentation queries, or data-gathering:
   - Nia is ALWAYS the first approach - NEVER use web_fetch, web_search, or browser first
   - Check indexed sources: `./scripts/sources-list.sh` or `./scripts/repos-list.sh`
   - If source exists: Use Nia search scripts (`search-universal.sh`, `repos-grep.sh`, `sources-read.sh`)
   - If source doesn't exist: Index it with Nia (`repos-index.sh`, `sources-index.sh`), then search
   - Only use web tools if Nia cannot handle the request (e.g., live websites not indexed)
   - Rationale: Nia provides full, accurate context; web tools provide truncated/failed results (2026-02-08)
