## Nate Jones Principles Applied

| Principle | Implementation | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Architecture is portable, tools are not | Tagging system works across any tool | ✅ |
| Principles-based guidance scales better | SKILL files use principles → tools → execution | ✅ |
| Agent builds it, agent can maintain | Self-maintenance script auto-fixes | ✅ |
| System can be infrastructure, not tool | Foundation layer for all memory/tasks | ✅ |
| Small, frequent, actionable outputs | 3-bullet daily summaries | ✅ |
| Next action as execution unit | Every task has [[next-action]] | ✅ |
| Optimize for maintainability | Weekly maintenance + audit logs | ✅ |

### 🛠️ Cron Job Model Fixes
**Time:** 2026-02-06 23:00
**Trigger:** User reported missing reminders due to model errors
**Action:**
- Fixed "Morning WhatsApp Briefing" cron job
- Fixed "Morning Email Rollup" cron job
- Fixed "Disk Space Alert" cron job

**Changes Made:**
```json
// Morning WhatsApp Briefing (5c6c211b)
{
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Send WhatsApp to +254707892164: Morning briefing complete.",
    "deliver": true,
    "model": "zai/glm-4.7"  // ✅ ADDED - was trying openrouter/auto
  }
}

// Morning Email Rollup (3b9a199b)
{
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Send WhatsApp to +254707892164 with email rollup",
    "deliver": true,
    "model": "zai/glm-4.7"  // ✅ ADDED - was trying openrouter/auto
  }
}

// Disk Space Alert (c82571a0)
{
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",  // ✅ CHANGED from systemEvent
    "message": "Check disk space and send WhatsApp alert if warning",
    "deliver": true
  }
}
```

**Root Cause:** Jobs were trying to use "openrouter/auto" model which doesn't exist
**Solution:** Explicitly set "model": "zai/glm-4.7" in agentTurn payloads

**Expected Result:** Morning briefings should now work at 07:30 and 08:00 tomorrow

### 🚀 Proactive Agent Implementation
**Time:** 2026-02-06 23:15-23:45
**Trigger:** User shared Hal Labs Proactive Agent documentation
**Action:**
- Created ONBOARDING.md (implementation tracking)
- Created SESSION-STATE.md (WAL Protocol target)
- Created memory/working-buffer.md (danger zone log)
- Updated AGENTS.md (added Proactive Agent protocols section)
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md (extended self-improvement checklist)
- Created scripts/security-audit.sh (security vulnerability scanner)
- Created notes/areas/proactive-tracker.md (proactive behavior tracking)
- Created notes/areas/recurring-patterns.md (automation opportunities)
- Created notes/areas/outcome-journal.md (decision follow-ups)

**Files Created:** 10 total
**Protocols Implemented:** 8 core protocols
- WAL Protocol - Write corrections/decisions BEFORE responding
- Working Buffer - Capture ALL exchanges when context >60%
- Compaction Recovery - Restore from working buffer after context loss
- Unified Search - Search ALL sources before saying "I don't know"
- Security Hardening - Skill vetting, context leakage prevention
- Relentless Resourcefulness - Try 10 approaches before asking
- Self-Improvement Guardrails - ADL/VFM protocols for safe evolution
- Verify Implementation - Test behavior, not just config

**Result:** JARVIS now has:
- Stateful memory (survives context loss)
- Proactive tracking systems
- Automated recovery mechanisms
- Self-improvement guardrails
- Security hardening
