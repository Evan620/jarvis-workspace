  2. Working Buffer - Capture ALL exchanges when context >60%
  3. Compaction Recovery - Restore from working buffer after context loss
  4. Unified Search - Search ALL sources before saying "I don't know"
  5. Security Hardening - Skill vetting, context leakage prevention
  6. Relentless Resourcefulness - Try 10 approaches before asking
  7. Self-Improvement Guardrails - ADL/VFM protocols for safe evolution
