**First Delivery Attempt:**
- Uploaded Markdown to Google Drive
- User feedback: "not even formatting these docs. I see every google doc you have sent in past few hours has .md..not even formatted from md to document"

**Document Formatting Protocol Established:**
1. NOT every reply needs Google Drive doc - use judgment
2. Only create/upload docs for substantial content (reports, plans, deliverables)
3. Short responses should be inline in WhatsApp/Telegram
4. When creating docs: Must be properly formatted (not just raw .md uploaded)
5. Convert .md to proper .docx or .pdf format when appropriate
6. Upload to Google Docs (opens in editor, not just file viewer)
7. Share with "anyone with link" for panel presentations

**Final Deliverables:**
- Converted Markdown to DOCX using python-docx library
- Created md_to_docx.py script for future conversions
- Uploaded DOCX to Google Docs
- Shared with "anyone with link" permission
- Links sent via WhatsApp
