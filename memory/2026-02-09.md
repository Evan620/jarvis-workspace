# 2026-02-09 - Daily Notes

## Key Activities

### Morning
- Discussed AfDB $10B AI Infrastructure Fund visualizations
- Created 3-part interactive HTML reports using data-viz-construction skill
- Deployed to GitHub Pages with unified hub page
- Sent URLs via WhatsApp

### Mid-Day
- Installed find-skills CLI from Vercel Labs
- Created cron job for daily trending skills search (11:00 AM)
- Searched Vercel ecosystem for blockchain/crypto skills - none found
- Attempted to use Nia for deep research - credits exhausted

### Evening
- Discussed 6 blockchain/crypto skill areas:
  1. Jurisdiction assessment
  2. Real world asset tokenization
  3. Tokenomics
  4. Token issuance processes
  5. Community building
  6. Blockchain platform selection
- Received KRA PIN certificate document
- System reminder about disk usage (86% - WhatsApp alert sent)

## Decisions

- **Vercel vs GitHub Pages:** Used GitHub Pages for AI Data Center visualizations due to TLS certificate issues in OpenClaw environment
- **Nia Credits:** Exhausted (0 credits remaining), need 30-40 credits for comprehensive blockchain/crypto skill creation
- **Skills Approach:** Pending purchase of Nia credits to create deep, well-informed skills rather than shallow ones

## Technical Notes

- **Vercel CLI Skills:** Installed at ~/.agents/skills/find-skills/
- **Cron Job ID:** 17ecd4b3-5079-4b9e-8e56-053909944e38
- **Disk Usage:** 94GB/116GB (86%) - Needs cleanup

## Pending Items

1. [TOMORROW] Blockchain/crypto skills - Purchase Nia credits, conduct deep research, create 6 skills
2. [TOMORROW] Disk cleanup - Address 86% capacity issue
3. [ONGOING] Monitor daily trending skills cron job effectiveness

## Learnings

- Vercel Labs skills ecosystem is focused on web/dev tools, not blockchain/crypto
- Nia provides much better depth than web_fetch for comprehensive skill creation
- Skills ecosystem is still emerging - many niches (blockchain, crypto) not covered yet
